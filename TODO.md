- [x] integrate libdivsufsort as reference (for single node run time and
      testing)
- [~] unified C++ interface between libdivsufsort and psac
- [x] implement testing against libdivsufsort
- [x] test against chr22
- [ ] document library functions
- [~] clean iterator interface
- [ ] distributed correctness test
- [x] multiseq merge after samplesort all2all (should be faster than another
      round of sorting) [in-place]
- [x] LCP
- [ ] BWT
- [~] get wavefront and other paper's code and compare
- [x] implementation for few unresolved buckets
- [x] clean up test code
